# my Portfolio

This is the repository for my personal portfolio built with Next.js, where I showcase my projects, skills, professional experiences, and contact information.
I created this portfolio to have a professional space where I can introduce myself and centralize my main work as a developer.
It was built with a focus on performance, responsiveness, and modern web development best practices.
